# sodapy tutorial using NYC Open Data  
Author: Mark Bauer

# Introduction  
This project demonstrates how to:  
- use sodapy (i.e. the python client for the Socrata API) and  
- provides examples of the Socrata Query Language (also known as SoQL) 

Additionally, inspiration for this project came from the [sodapy GitHub page](https://github.com/xmunoz/sodapy). Much of what I learned about sodapy, as well as working with the Socrata API, came from these developers. I encourage you to review the official sodapy GitHub page to have a better and more complete understanding of sodapy (e.g. installation, requirements, available methods, etc.). This tutorial is meant to complement the official sodapy docs.

# Data
